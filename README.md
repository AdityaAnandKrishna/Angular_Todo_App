Sir, you may have a lot of options,you might also find people much experienced, but I think you won't find the people who can beat my attitude.
The internship profile and my skill set I see is 100 met and I don't find any reason why I should not be selected.
I need a chance to learn  and explore myself which in a way will benificial to as well.
The words just can't justify my actions until I get the right opportunity to perform. I will be very privileged if you avail me this opportunity.
